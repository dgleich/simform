* Make the conversion to a matrix independent of the numbering
of the initial exodus files

* Insert new interpolation scripts that provide sum-to-1 constraints

* Insert new interpolation scripts for the singular vectors

* Allow analysis scripts to work directly on intermediately predicted
exodus files

* Allow construction of the model to determine the number of 
exodus files itself
